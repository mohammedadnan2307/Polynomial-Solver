# Polynomial-Solver

Polynomial Solver is a tool that can calculate real roots and critical points of any real polynomial of any degree, with other interesting features such as calculating the area under the curve, the length of a curve in an interval, and finding the equation of polynomial whose real roots are known.

Also, it contains features to plot interactive user graphs of the polynomial. You can check out this tool here,

## Calculate Roots

The input must be a simplified expression of a polynomial. The expression is written as a function of x, f(x). Expression must contain real values and exponents must be non-negative integers only.
